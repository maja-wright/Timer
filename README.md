# Timer
A Timer which counts downwards to zero.
Count down from 30 to 0, from 50 to zero or any amount you want. You choose.

It's a simple Timer application inside a browser , with the text input to write the number (the starting time) and play and pause buttons. Whenever the user clicks on the play button, the timer is going to count the time down. The default value starts at 30 seconds, and after each second will go down, until it comes all the way down to zero. Also, a user can click on the text input and change the number. As that timer is counting down, the user can pause it any time, by clicking on the pause button and then resume it by clicking on the play button again.  
But what makes this timer a little bit more challenging is the circle drawn around the element. And as the timer counts down the animated border is decreasing to zero as well.
